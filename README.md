# induction-disambiguation-dataset-generator
This framework uses OntoNotes (https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T19) in order to provide a dataset with different parameters such as (1) inter-annotator-agreement levels, (2) sense lexicon (e.g., WordNet 3.0), and (3) minimum number of instances for each target word.


Current compatibilities:
- WordNet 3.0
- Ontonotes 5.0
